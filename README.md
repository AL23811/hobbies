Hello World! and thank you for visisting my website it really means a lot to me. I have been working very hard on this Hobbies website trying to master my skills like HTML, CSS, FelexBox and Grid just to name a few. I really learned a lot
But I am Always open to some Feedback as we are always learning and working to a better tomorrow agian i thank you for your time and i hope you enjoy viewing my site as much as i enjoyed making it.

//** some things to keep in mind **//
1: this site is not a professional website.

2: this website is better on a larger screen but was made 
adaptable to smaller screens like phones and tablets.

3: this is a website for my final progject for school our assiment was to work with 
CSs and Html primaraly so if things like forms dont work properly yet its mainly intentional. 

in counclution thank you for your time, and ENJOY!!
